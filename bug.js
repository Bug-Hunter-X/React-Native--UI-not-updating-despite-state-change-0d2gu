This error occurs when you use a state variable inside a function component in React Native without properly using the useState hook.  For example:

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  let count = 0;
  const incrementCount = () => {
    count++;
    console.log(count); // This will not re-render the component
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

In this case, even though `count` updates, the component does not re-render because React doesn't know that the state has changed.  It only tracks changes to state variables managed via `useState`.
